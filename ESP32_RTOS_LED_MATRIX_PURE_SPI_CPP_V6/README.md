This project was created with the intent to test/learn some features related to ESP32 programming using C++.

It performs no useful tasks but I belive it covers ome interesting concepts such as:

1 - Direct LED Matrix control using SPI (instead of the usual library MD_Parola.

2 - Multi-task scheduling using both of ESP32's cores

3 - Touch interface

4 - Deep sleep and wakeup

5 - Interrupt

6 - Timers

7 - Queues

8 - Mutex for synchrozination

9 - Modern C++ constructs such lambda functions and std::ranges.
